Based on the database provided (hotel_bookings.csv), the goal was to develop models to predict the following: bookings cancellation and number of nights for any new booking. 
The solution consists of three parts. Part 1 is cleaning and preparing the data. Part 2 is exploring the data and coming up with several use cases as a way of familiarizing myself with the data. Part 3 is the part where the actual Machine Learning models were developed. Different models were set up and the corresponding performances were compared and discussed further.
